# Internship Work

This repository documents the work I completed during my internship at **Vault of Code** from **1 July 2025** to **1 August 2025**.  
The internship focused on **Prompt Engineering**, which involves crafting, testing, and refining prompts to optimize outputs from AI models like GPT.  
Throughout the internship, I explored techniques for improving AI responses, designing structured prompts, automating workflows, and integrating prompts into applications.

## ðŸ§  Internship Overview â€“ Prompt Engineering
Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and optimizing the inputs given to AI models to achieve precise, reliable, and context-aware outputs.  
During this internship, I:
- Learned and applied prompt design principles (clarity, context, constraints).
- Experimented with different prompt formats to control tone, style, and content.
- Practiced basic Python programming (error handling, web designing, etc.).
- Developed a **Major Project**: an AI Assistant with a web interface for real-time prompt execution.
